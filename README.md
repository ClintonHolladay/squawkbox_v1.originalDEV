# squawk-box
This repository is for all of the versions of the microcontroller-based squawk box.  A1_V1 is the latest version that is ready for field testing.  
It uses a Rugged-Circuits Mega.  There is currently no datalogging for this version.
Squawk with telemetry is a work in progress.  It uses TagoIO for logging and visualization.
